Game of Life
============

This effort was the final pairing we did for the Cleveland CodeRetreat on the @Leandog boat o 16 January, 2011.

I wanted to work with @chadfowler -- to absorb ruyisms.

I also was hell-bent on getting the stupid simulation working.

We succeeded!

I made a minor tweak to increase the board size and make the printing "fancier" when running from the terminal.

*SHIP IT!*

You'll want to check out the videos, or simply run gol.rb yourself.

It's kinda cool to watch it in action.

* You can see clumps of 4 cells static for a while. 
* You can see blinker patterns. 
* You can see parts of the world die off.

It is quite a bit of fun to watch a board of size 50 or more in action.
